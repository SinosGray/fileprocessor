spooling 假脱机
(Spooling is a process in which data is temporarily held to be used and executed by a device, program or the system. Data is sent to and stored in memory or other volatile storage until the program or computer requests it for execution.
"Spool" is technically an acronym for simultaneous peripheral operations online.
For example, in printer spooling, the documents/files that are sent to the printer are **first stored in the memory or printer spooler.** Once the printer is ready, it fetches the data from that spool and prints it.)

demand paging(512words)
(It suggests keeping all pages of the frames in the secondary memory until they are required. In other words, it says that do not load any page in the main memory until it is required.)

concept of kernal: 
The system has no built-in assumptions about program scheduling and resource allocation; it allows any program to initiate other programs in a hierarchal manner.5 Thus, the system provides a general frame[work] for different scheduling strategies, such as batch processing, multiple console conversation, real-time scheduling, etc.
